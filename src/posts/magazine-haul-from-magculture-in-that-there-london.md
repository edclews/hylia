A recent trip down to that there London to get some culture in the V&A (chock full), Tate Modern (almost empty) and the Serpentine Gallery ([excellent James Barnor exhibition](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/james-barnor/)) meant I could finally get to go to [magCulture](https://magculture.com/). I had to restrict myself a bit but here's what I got.

## Far Ride

A high gloss travel cycling mag. This issue is mostly geared around around cycling in places like Mexico City, Western Ukraine and Afghanistan. At first impression it did give the look of an overly inspirational travel mag like Suitcase but thankfully has more depth and thought it than that.

Sadly their website and Instagram pages don't seem to be working so they may have gone under.

## Cheese

My wife spotted this from miles away. She loves cheese, therefore I bought it. I've not got far in it so far but a good mix of illustration and photography in this one.

## Safar

A bilingual visual culture magazine from Beirut - this magazine has definitely had the most attention from this batch. I like seeing how different languages and alphabets work together in design and Safar's style uses this really well, with a bright look that balances out writing that can be on quite intense subjects.  

You can find them at https://www.journalsafar.com/

## Counterpoint

A really nicely illustrated magazine about play. Printed in risograph which makes it feel light and fun.

## Eighty

This is the one I've looked at least, it's about tea culture. Looks nice though.
