I'm trying this Eleventy blog system to see how it works. It's partly an excuse to get back into the habit of writing and also working out how Netlify works.

Twitter is a constant conveyor belt of short content and links. Facebook's timeline is seemingly random.  Typekit, Tumblr, Blogspot and the like are now either pay models or slowly disappearing.

So why not get back into it and see where it goes.
